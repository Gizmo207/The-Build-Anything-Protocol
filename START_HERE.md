# Start Here

This repository is the authoritative source of the Build Anything Protocol.
It defines the folder semantics, decision rules, and governance used when you apply the protocol inside a product repository.

## How to enter the protocol

Choose your most natural entry point based on what you are building:

- If you are building a backend/API, start with `01_prd`.
- If you are building a user-facing app, start with `03_user_journeys`.
- If you are building infra/tools, start with `04_capabilities`.

## Important: protocol order does not change

These entry points are for orientation only.
The protocol’s phase order remains the canonical sequence from `01_prd` through `10_delivery_and_ops`.
