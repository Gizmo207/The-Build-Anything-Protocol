# Audience

## Primary audience
Developers and small teams who need to expose existing data sources as APIs quickly, without building a bespoke backend service for every new product or integration.

## Secondary audience
- Engineering leads who need predictable delivery and governance.
- Internal platform teams who want to standardize API publishing.
- Product teams who need faster experiments without compromising safety.

## Non-audience
- Teams looking for a general-purpose database admin UI.
- Teams seeking a full API gateway replacement.
- Teams who want implicit, automatic exposure of entire databases by default.
