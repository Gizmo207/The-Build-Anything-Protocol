# Governance (Plain-English)

## What is governance?
Governance is the set of rules about **who is allowed to make rules**.

It’s like a school:
- Students can’t change the grading rules.
- Teachers follow the grading rules.
- The school decides who can change the rulebook, and how.

## Why governance matters
Without governance, teams get:
- Duplicated rules
- Conflicting rules
- “Temporary exceptions” that never go away

## Two key governance ideas
### Decision ownership
Every important rule has exactly one owner.
That stops “everyone decides” chaos.

### Invariant enforcement
Some rules are so important they must be checked at the door.
Not only written on a sign.

## The big idea
Governance turns good intentions into consistent behavior.
