# Checkpoints (Plain-English)

## What is a checkpoint?
A checkpoint is like a **save point in a video game**.

At a checkpoint we:
- Stop moving fast for a moment.
- Look around.
- Write down what is true.
- Write down what we are **not** doing yet (on purpose).

## Why do checkpoints matter?
Without checkpoints, teams can accidentally:
- Forget what the rules were.
- Build the next part on top of unfinished foundations.
- Mix up “plans” with “things that are real.”

Checkpoints prevent that.

## What a checkpoint always includes
- What is complete
- What is intentionally not started
- How the work follows the protocol
- What risks we are choosing to accept for now
- What checkpoint comes next

## The big idea
A checkpoint is a **receipt of reality**.
It lets humans (and AI) agree on the truth before continuing.
