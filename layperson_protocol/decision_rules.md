# Decision Rules (Plain-English)

## What is a decision rule?
A decision rule is like a **rulebook**.

If you ask it the same question twice, it must give the same answer.
It does not guess.

## Why we treat decision rules as special
Decision rules are the system’s **gates**.
They decide “yes” or “no” before anything dangerous or irreversible happens.

## Default behavior: lock first
When the system is unsure, it should act like a door with a lock:
- If we don’t have enough information → the door stays locked.

This prevents accidents.

## What decision rules are NOT
- They are not “opinions.”
- They are not “UI checks.”
- They are not “best effort.”

## The big idea
Decision rules make safety predictable.
They are how we avoid repeating past mistakes.
